# AI Research Studies

This repository contains empirical studies in machine learning and artificial
intelligence, with a focus on evaluation, generalization, and interpretability.

## Project 1: Neural Network Generalization
This study analyzes how model capacity and training data size affect
generalization behaviour in neural networks. Experiments are evaluated using
repeated runs and learning curves.

## Project 2: Stability and Faithfulness of Model Explanations
This study investigates whether feature importance explanations are stable
across runs and faithful to the underlying model behaviour, using permutation
importance and controlled feature-removal tests.

Each project folder contains the corresponding code, figures, and a short
project-specific README.
