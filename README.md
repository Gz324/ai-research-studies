# Neural Network Generalization Study

This project explores how neural network generalization is affected by
model capacity and the amount of training data.

## Overview
The experiments are designed to observe patterns in training and test
error rather than optimize for performance. Results are averaged over
multiple runs to account for variability due to random initialization.

## Experiments
- Effect of model capacity (number of hidden units) on generalization
- Learning curves across different training set sizes
