# Reasoning with Soft Logical Constraints

This project studies reasoning under conflicting logical rules using soft
constraints, where rule violations incur penalties instead of being strictly
forbidden.

## Overview
All possible logical worlds are evaluated and scored based on how well they
satisfy a set of weighted logical rules. The analysis focuses on identifying
worlds with minimal total penalty rather than perfect consistency.

## Key Concepts
- Soft logic and weighted constraints
- Reasoning over all possible assignments
- Trade-offs between conflicting rules

## Files
- soft_logic_reasoning.py: implementation of soft logical reasoning
- soft_logic_penalties.png: penalty distribution across logical worlds
